# Need a Light?

A mod for the game [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/).

Adds 2 tools used to start a fire. The first is the simple flint and steel. And the second is a hardy fliptop steel lighter. Craftable at a crafting spot or smithy.

Be careful, your pawns can burn themselves using these tools.

This is an early release and might be bugs. Please let me know here: [issues](https://github.com/patrick-russell/NeedALight/issues)
