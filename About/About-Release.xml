    Fire When you want it. Need a light?
    Adds 2 tools used to start a fire. The first is the simple flint and steel. And the second is a hardy fliptop steel lighter. Craftable at a crafting spot or smithy.

    Be careful, your pawns can burn themselves using these tools.

    This is an early release and might be bugs. Please let me know here: https://github.com/patrick-russell/NeedALight/issues
